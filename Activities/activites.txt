1) Strips Match / Re-arrange Board (12 min) — multi‑column
Your idea: perfect as Round 1.

Put strips in 3 columns: Birth/Prakash, Gurta Gaddi, Joti Jot (mixed).
Teams must build correct rows for 4–5 Gurus (you choose subset).
Scoring (max 4):
+1 correct Guru name row
+1 correct Birth date
+1 correct Gurta Gaddi date
+1 correct Joti Jot date
Then immediate 2–3 min archery.
2) Half‑Filled Cards (12–15 min)
Your idea: “complete missing values, then guess missing based on filled values”.

Each team gets 3 cards:
Card A: Guru name + 2 dates filled, 1 missing
Card B: Guru name + Father/Mother filled, missing spouse/child
Card C: Only dates shown → identify Guru
Scoring (max 4):
+1 per correctly completed card (3)
+1 “explain how you knew” (one sentence, Captain says it)
Then archery.
3) Draw a Guru Sahib Ji Card + Draw Fact Cards (12 min)
Make it fast and theatrical.

Deck 1: Guru cards (names)
Deck 2: Fact cards: “Birth/Prakash”, “Gurta Gaddi”, “Joti Jot”, “Father”, “Mother”, “Spouse”, “Child”
A student draws 1 Guru + 2 Fact cards and must say both facts correctly.
Scoring (max 4):
+1 per correct fact (up to 3)
+1 “steal” if another team catches an error and corrects it respectfully
Then archery.
4) Computational Questions (15–18 min)
This is where they get busy (and quieter if timed).
Give each team the same sheet, 8 questions, 8 minutes solve time.

Good question patterns (from your list), with quick-check rules:

Born X years ago: use year only: 2025 − birth_year
Gurta Gaddi X years ago: 2025 − gurgaddi_year
Lived longer: (death_year − birth_year) compare two
If 2025 − ___ = ____: identify which Guru’s (Birth/Gurta Gaddi/Joti Jot) year matches
Text search: “Mother name contains ‘Devi’ ” (or “Mata” / “Kaur”)
Scoring (max 4):

+1 for 2 correct
+2 for 5 correct
+3 for 7 correct
+4 for all 8 correct
Then archery.
5) Final Boss (10–12 min): “Build the full chain”
On the board: blank chain boxes (11 including Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji).
Teams race to fill the correct order + one date per Guru (you pick: Gurta Gaddi year).
Scoring (max 6, last big payout):
+3 correct full order
+2 correct Gurta Gaddi years for at least 8 entries
+1 best teamwork/quiet discipline (your judgement)
Final archery showdown with all saved tokens.
